# Pricing Strategy

## Core Principle: Charge Premium

"There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive." — Dan Kennedy

## The Virtuous Cycle of Price

### When You Lower Prices
- Decrease client emotional investment (didn't cost much)
- Decrease perceived value ("can't be that good if it's cheap")
- Decrease client results (they don't value it, aren't invested)
- Attract worst clients (never satisfied until it's free)
- Destroy margins → can't provide exceptional experience → service declines

### When You Raise Prices
- Increase client emotional investment
- Increase perceived value
- Increase client results (they're invested, follow through)
- Attract best clients (easiest to satisfy, cost less to fulfill)
- Multiply margins → invest in systems, people, experience, scale

**Higher price literally = higher value.** Wine study: same wine labeled at 3 different prices — tasters rated the "expensive" one as significantly better. Price changes perception.

**Those who pay the most, pay the most attention.** If your customers are more adherent and get better results, you're providing more value. This is how you win.

## The 1/10th Price-to-Value Rule

Price should be 1/10th of the value/return clients receive.

| Price | Client Should Generate |
|-------|----------------------|
| $1k/mo | $10k/mo in value |
| $5k/mo | $50k/mo in value |
| $10k | $100k in value |

If the minimum return is 10x, you will never have a retention problem. Getting beyond 10x is more a function of fulfillment improvement vs pricing.

## Pricing Recommendations by Offer Type

### New Offers (Limited Proof)
- **Agency:** $2.5k - $3k/month with 3-4 month minimum
- **Coaching/consulting (biz opp):** $4,800 for 12-16 weeks
- **Coaching/consulting (health/relationships):** $2,800 - $3,800 for 12-16 weeks

Price low enough that price isn't an objection. Optimize for FLOW (new clients) over profit early.

### Established Offers (With Results)
Take 5-10 best client results → average monthly return → divide by 10.

- **Agency:** $3k/m+ for 4 months min
- **Coaching (biz opp):** $6,800+ for 12-16 weeks
- **Coaching (health/relationships):** $4,800+ for 12-16 weeks

## When to Increase Prices

Increase when BOTH:
- Close rate > 30%
- Cash collected > 50% of contract value

If both are above KPI, your prices are too low. Increase by $2k on the package. Find new baseline. Repeat.

As you increase price, you may also need to increase value to maintain 1/10th ratio.

## Accelerate Cash Flow: PIF Strategy

Never pitch monthly amounts. Pitch 3-4 months upfront, then retain monthly.

**Example:** If you charge $5k/mo, pitch "$20k for 4 months."

Impact comparison (10 closes):
- Monthly pitch: 10 × $3k = $30k collected
- PIF pitch (50% PIF): 5 × $12k + 5 × $3k = $75k collected

$30k vs $75k from the same 10 clients. Massive cash flow acceleration for scaling and adspend.

If prospect can't PIF → downsell to payment plans (what you would've pitched anyway).

## Rolling Out Price Increases

1. Get highest-performing closer to use new pricing first
2. Keep rest of team at current price
3. Once top closer hits KPI at new price, roll to full team
4. Top closer coaches rest of team on what changed (usually not much)

## Pricing Power Math (Hormozi)

Doubling prices produces the biggest profit impact of any business lever:

| Lever | Revenue Impact | Profit Impact |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 2x Customers | 2x revenue | 3.5x profit |
| 2x Retention | 2x revenue | 3.5x profit |
| **2x Price** | **2x revenue** | **6x profit** |

Price doubles are 6x profit because cost to acquire and cost to deliver stay the same while revenue doubles. The delta goes straight to margin.

## Profitability KPIs for Scaling

| Metric | KPI | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Ad spend as % of P&L | 20-25% | Below 20% → spend more. Above 25% → fix close rates or costs |
| UF Cash % | 40-50% | Below 40% → too soft on payment terms. Above 50% → price too low |
| Cash ROAS | > 2x | Below 2x → very hard to scale. Fix close rate or ad costs |
| Revenue ROAS | > 5x | Based on LTV not contract value. Below 5x → fulfillment or backend issues |
| Close Rate | > 25% | Minimum for qualified, live calls |
| CPBC (Cost Per Booked Call) | Contextual | Calculate from price, cash %, close rate, cancel rate, show rate |
