# Offer Enhancers: Scarcity, Urgency, Bonuses, Guarantees & Naming

These external forces are often MORE powerful than the core offer itself. They increase demand and decrease perceived supply.

**Core principle:** "Desire comes from not getting what you want." Keep supply under demand. Satisfy less desire than you generate.

## 1. Scarcity (Function of Quantity)

Fear of missing out on limited supply. Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain.

### Three Types

**a) Limited Supply of Seats/Slots**
- Total Business Cap: "We only accept 25 clients total. Period."
- Growth Rate Cap: "We only accept 5 new clients per week. 3 spots already taken."
- Cohort Cap: "We take 100 clients 4x per year. Doors open then close."

**b) Limited Supply of Bonuses**
- "Only people who sign up get access to Bonus #1, #2, #3 — never available elsewhere."

**c) Never Available Again**
- Limited edition releases — must always sell out
- Let everyone know you sold out (social proof + increased future desire)

### Honest Scarcity
Simply define a real number you can handle and advertise it. "We're 81% to capacity" — implies social proof and urgency naturally.

### Key Rules
- Always sell out (better to under-supply than over-supply)
- Always announce when you sold out
- Compounds in effectiveness over time

## 2. Urgency (Function of Time)

Limit WHEN people can sign up, not how many.

### Four Types

**a) Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency**
- "Sign up today to get in our next group Monday, otherwise wait until next kickoff."
- Less frequent starts = more urgency

**b) Rolling Seasonal Urgency**
- New Year Promo → Valentine's Promo → Spring Promo → etc.
- Same promotion, different seasonal wrapper with start/end dates
- Deadlines drive decisions

**c) Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency**
- "Take advantage of this discount/bonus before it changes — we rotate every 4 weeks."
- Never lie about the promotion — talk about the promotion expiring, not the service

**d) Exploding Opportunity**
- Arbitrage or market timing: every day they wait, they miss out on disproportionate gains
- "The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make"

### Key Rule
The biggest sales on any campaign happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (50-60% of total). Urgency works.

## 3. Bonuses (Expand Price-to-Value Discrepancy)

A single offer is LESS valuable than the same offer broken into components and stacked as bonuses.

### Presentation Rules

**1-on-1 selling:** Ask for the sale FIRST. If they say yes → reveal bonuses as a wow experience. If they say no → present bonus matching their objection, ask again. Then another bonus, ask again.

**Never discount the core offer.** Add bonuses instead. Discounting teaches customers your prices are negotiable.

### Bonus Creation Checklist
1. Always offer them
2. Give each a special name with a benefit in the title
3. For each bonus, explain:
   - How it relates to their issue
   - What it is
   - How you discovered/created it
   - How it improves their life (faster, easier, less effort)
4. Provide proof (stat, past client, personal experience)
5. Paint vivid mental image of life after using it
6. Ascribe a price tag and justify it
7. Tools & checklists > additional trainings (less effort = more value)
8. Each should address a specific concern/obstacle
9. Solve the NEXT problem they'd logically encounter
10. Total bonus value should ECLIPSE core offer value
11. Add scarcity/urgency to bonuses themselves for steroids effect

### Advanced: Other People's Products
Get adjacent businesses to provide free services/products as bonuses:
- Free marketing for them, high-value bonuses for you at zero cost
- Negotiate group discounts AND referral commissions
- Can literally justify your entire price in savings

## 4. Guarantees (Reverse Risk)

Risk is the #1 objection. Reversing risk can 2-4x conversion.

### Four Types

**a) Unconditional**
- No questions asked, money back. Strongest form.
- "If you don't like it for any reason, just ask and we'll refund."

**b) Conditional**
- Money back IF specific conditions are met.
- "If you do X, Y, Z and don't get the result, we refund."
- **This is the recommended approach for agency/consulting offers.**

**c) Anti-Guarantee**
- "All sales are final. No refunds. This is for serious people only."
- Works when combined with massive proof and premium positioning

**d) Implied Guarantee**
- Performance-based pricing, rev-share, pay-per-result
- "You only pay when you get results" = implied guarantee without saying it

### Stacking Guarantees
Combine multiple guarantees for maximum power. Example:
- Unconditional 30-day refund + Conditional outcome guarantee + "We'll pay you $X if we fail"

### Conditional Refund Stipulations (For Agencies)

Ask: "In order for a client to generate [outcome], what exactly do they need to do?"

Example stipulations:
- Must call all leads within 3 hours
- Must spend minimum $X/day on ads for 90 days
- Must send call recordings of every sales call
- Must implement every amendment/change recommended
- Must send daily breakdown of every lead spoken with
- Must return new creatives within 7 days

**Side benefit:** Stipulations INCREASE client results because clients do the required actions to stay eligible for the refund. They get the result, so you don't refund. Win-win.

### The Math
If guarantee increases closes by 30% and refund rate doubles from 5% to 10%:
- Old: 100 sales, 5 refunds = 95 net
- New: 130 sales, 13 refunds = 117 net
- Net gain: 23% more revenue

### Downselling the Guarantee

For agency offers using Meta Ads, run the aggressive guarantee in ads but downsell on the call:

1. **Main offer (in ads):** Big promise for top-of-market clients (e.g., "90 qualified calls/month or you don't pay")
2. **Logical explanation:** "Our guarantee requires $X/day adspend, and since yours is at $Y..."
3. **Downsell offer:** Still desirable but achievable with their resources (e.g., "50 qualified calls in 90 days")

**90% of clients buy the downsell.** That's by design. Never bait and switch — the main offer is 100% available, they just need to meet the terms.

## 5. Naming (The MAGIC Formula)

A great name re-stimulates demand and communicates value instantly.

**M**ake a Magnetic Reason Why — What's the compelling hook?
**A**nnounce Your Avatar — Who is it for?
**G**ive Them a Goal — What will they achieve?
**I**ndicate a Time Frame — How fast?
**C**omplete with a Container Word — What is it? (Challenge, Blueprint, System, Accelerator, Bootcamp, Intensive, Incubator, Masterclass, Program, Experience, Workshop)

**Example:** "The 6-Week Lean Body Challenge for Busy Moms"
- Magnetic: "Lean Body"
- Avatar: "Busy Moms"
- Goal: "Lean Body"
- Timeframe: "6 Weeks"
- Container: "Challenge"

### Naming Tips
- Use alliteration when possible
- Avoid commoditized terms (e.g., "marketing services")
- Make it impossible to Google and find a competitor offering the same thing
- Each bonus in your stack also gets its own compelling name
