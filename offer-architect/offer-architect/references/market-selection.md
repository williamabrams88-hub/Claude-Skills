# Market Selection & Niche Analysis

## The Starving Crowd Principle

The most important factor in business success. A starving crowd beats a great offer and great persuasion skills combined.

**Priority order:** Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills

## Four Market Indicators

Evaluate every potential market on these four criteria:

### 1. Massive Pain
- They must *desperately need* (not just want) the solution
- Degree of pain = proportional to price you can charge
- "The pain is the pitch" — if you can articulate their pain accurately, they almost always buy
- The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to *feel understood*

### 2. Purchasing Power
- The audience must be able to afford the service at the prices required
- Target people with money or access to money
- Don't sell to broke people no matter how much pain they have

### 3. Easy to Target
- Can you find these people through associations, mailing lists, social media groups, channels?
- If finding them is like needles in a haystack, the offer falls on deaf ears
- Tactical reality: your ads must reach the right people

### 4. Growing Market
- Growing markets = tailwind (everything moves forward faster)
- Declining markets = headwind (all efforts harder)
- At minimum: "normal" market growing at market rate
- Three evergreen markets: Health, Wealth, Relationships

## TAM (Total Addressable Market) for Paid Ads

Ideal TAM for running Meta Ads: **30,000 - 100,000 people** in the target geography.

- **Below 30k**: Not enough scale for ads
- **Above 100k**: Messaging is too broad; narrow down to a segment
- For B2B: TAM applies to the revenue level, not just the niche count
  - Example: 50k coffee businesses but only 10k making >$500k/yr — if targeting $500k+, need to expand niche or go adjacent

**Finding TAM:** Search Google for industry reports, association membership numbers, census data.

## Pre-existing Desire

Never try to *create* desire. Find the market's pre-existing desire and *channel* it into your offer.

**The Key Question:** "If I asked every person in this market segment what they want, what would 80%+ tell me? What is at the forefront of their mind every day?"

**The "Broken Arm" Method:** Find the market's most painful, obvious, urgent problem. Take the inverse of that problem and guarantee you will deliver a large amount of that thing in 90-180 days, or money back.

## Niche Down — The Pricing Multiplier

Niching down can enable 100x pricing for essentially the same product.

**Example progression (Dan Kennedy):**
1. "Time Management" → $19
2. "Time Management for Sales Professionals" → $99
3. "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps" → $499
4. "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps" → $2,000

**Why it works:**
- Specificity sells — especially on cold ads
- "This is made exactly for me" → willingly pay premium
- You become "the guy" for "this type of person" solving "this type of problem"

**When to broaden:** Generally not until $10M+/yr. Under that, almost always easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly.

## Commit to the Niche

- Don't half-heartedly try one offer, fail, and switch niches
- All markets have unpleasant characteristics — grass is never greener
- "Niche slap" = reminder to commit once you pick
- If you try 100 offers in one niche, you will succeed. Most people never try anything.

## Productizing: One Problem, One Person, One Method

To scale to $1M/mo+, productize:

1. **One singular problem** — Don't solve lead gen + social growth + CRO. Pick ONE.
2. **One particular person** — Same problem for same type of person. Every prospect has same problems/desires.
3. **One particular method** — One service/deliverable, delivered the same way every time.

**Result:** Every client has the exact same problems, desires, and business model. You implement the exact same service and client journey. NOW you have a scalable model.

## Speak to the Top of the Market

Focus your offer on the outcome you can achieve for your *most ideal, qualified, high-end client* who has every resource you require.

- If you speak to the top, you naturally get the top AND everyone below
- If you speak to the bottom, you only get the bottom
- The requirements for the top client (adspend, team size, location, etc.) become your qualification criteria
- 90% of buyers will buy your downsell, not your main offer — and that's by design
