# Ad Strategy for Meta Ads

## Core Philosophy

The job of marketing is to get strangers in the target market to book a sales call. The job of the sales call is to sell.

**In marketing/ads: Do NOT explain the specifics of the offer, product, or deliverables.** That's for the sales call. If you said "we run Facebook ads for you" in the ad, no one would click. Instead, lead with the outcome and guarantee.

## Ad Assembly Process

Ads are assembled from interchangeable parts, not created whole:

```
50 Hooks × 3-5 Meats × 1-3 CTAs = 150-750 ads per week
```

**Time allocation:**
- 80% Hooks
- 20% Meat
- ~0% CTAs

If someone doesn't make it through the hook, nothing else matters.

## Hooks (80% of Your Effort)

### Sources for Hook Ideas
1. **Winning hooks from your previous ads** (reuse winners)
2. **Winning hooks from free content** (cross-platform winners)
3. **Winning hooks from other people's ads** (save ads you like)
4. **Winning hooks from other people's content** (high-view content in your space)
5. **Platform ad libraries** (inspiration, not guaranteed winners)

### The 70-20-10 Rule (Google Innovation Model)
- **70% Core:** Use hooks already proven in your content/ads. "More of what works."
- **20% Emerging:** Model winners from other niches. "Winner adjacent."
- **10% Experimental:** Totally new ideas. Risky but could lead to huge wins.

### Hook Types (Verbal)
- **Labels:** "*Local business owners*, I have a gift for you"
- **Questions:** "Would you pay $1,000 to have the business of your dreams in 30 days?"
- **Conditionals:** "If you're working all the time and your business isn't growing..."
- **Commands:** "Read this if you're tired of being broke"
- **Statements:** "The more expensive it is, the easier it is to sell"
- **Lists/Steps:** "28 ways to stay poor"
- **Narratives:** "One day I was in the back and this old lady comes in..."
- **Exclamations:** "Ahhh... This is the blueprint to becoming a millionaire"

### Expansion Hooks by Awareness Level (Eugene Schwartz)

| Level | Hook Style | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Most Aware | Offer-driven | "50% off our best-selling XYZ for the rest of the month" |
| Product Aware | Proof-driven | "Why 10,000 people chose XYZ to solve [problem] last month" |
| Solution Aware | Promise-driven | "The fastest way to [desired result] - introducing XYZ" |
| Problem Aware | Pain-driven | "Tired of [specific problem]? There's a better way" |
| Completely Unaware | Curiosity-driven | "The hidden danger in your daily routine costing you [money/time/health]" |

**Rule:** If 90% of your hooks land in "Most Aware," spread them out to capture bigger slices. When in doubt, go broader.

## Ad Meat (20% of Your Effort — 3-5 Per Session)

### Five Formats

1. **Demonstration Ads** — Product showcases, unboxing, before/afters, comparisons, high-production hero ads
2. **Testimonial Ads** — UGC, direct to camera, podcast clips, raw iPhone testimonials, walk-n-talk rants, parade of proof (group), man-on-the-street, influencer collabs
3. **Education Ads** — Whiteboard explainers, how-to listicles, high-performing organic content repurposed
4. **Story Ads** — Storytelling, lifestyle, warnings/opportunities, documentary style, skits, brand manifestos
5. **Faceless Ads** — Screenshots of comments/texts, text-only, slideshows, animations, cartoon ads

## CTAs (1-3 Per Session)

A good CTA shows or tells:
1. **What to do:** "Take advantage of this offer by..."
2. **How to do it:** "...tapping the button on the bottom of your screen..."
3. **When to do it:** "...before it expires..."
4. **What they get:** "...and you'll get $1000 of free stuff..."
5. **What happens next:** "...delivered straight to your inbox."

**Demonstrate:** Show what happens at each step visually. Walk through clicking submit. Show the next page.

Apply urgency, scarcity, guarantees, and bonuses to CTAs.

## Scaling Ads

- Better ads > more budget
- You haven't saturated the market — you've hit a wall with ad quality
- The better the ad, the bigger the audience it converts (colder traffic converts)
- Find winners → double down → keep making variations of winners
- New customers enter the market daily — don't get bored repeating what works

## Application Structure for Quality Leads

The application (questionnaire before scheduling) serves two purposes:
1. **Decrease unqualified bookings** (trains the pixel)
2. **Provide enough info to cancel** unqualified bookings before the call

### Core Questions (B2B)
1. First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone
2. "Do you specifically own a [your niche]?" (Yes / No — leave immediately)
3. "What's your current monthly revenue?" (Options with DQ threshold)
4. "What is your core business? Describe what you do/offer and price point" (long answer)
5. "Are you 100% able to show up?" (Yes / No — with IP block warning for no-shows)

### Cancellation Criteria
Cancel if: not in niche, doesn't have the problem you solve, not financially qualified, or answers are extremely short (not serious).

Cancel 10-50% of bookings depending on niche. This INCREASES calendar efficiency = more money.

If you cancel a qualified person by mistake, they'll email. Reply: "My assistant cancels unqualified calls. I checked yours and saw [reason]. Can you tell me more?"
