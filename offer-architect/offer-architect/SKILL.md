# Offer Architect

Architect irresistible offers that cannot be compared to competitors, command premium prices, and scale profitably through Meta Ads.

## Workflow

Follow these six phases in order. Each phase builds on the previous. Read the referenced file **only when entering that phase** to keep context lean.

### Phase 1: Market Selection

Read `references/market-selection.md`.

Identify and validate the target market before touching the offer:

1. **Starving Crowd Check** — Does this market have massive pain, purchasing power, is easy to target on Meta, and growing?
2. **TAM Sizing** — Estimate the Total Addressable Market. Ideal for Meta Ads: 30k-100k businesses/people.
3. **Pre-existing Desire** — Confirm the market already wants to solve this problem (broken arm test).
4. **Niche Positioning** — Define one problem, one person, one method. Niching multiplies pricing power.
5. **Speak to Top of Market** — Frame everything for the highest-value segment; downsell from there.

### Phase 2: Offer Architecture

Read `references/value-equation.md` then `references/offer-creation.md`.

Build the core offer using the Grand Slam Offer process:

1. **Dream Outcome** — Name the single most desirable result the market wants.
2. **Value Equation Audit** — Score the offer across all four drivers:
   - Dream Outcome (increase) + Perceived Likelihood (increase)
   - Time Delay (decrease) + Effort & Sacrifice (decrease)
3. **Problem Mapping** — List 32-64+ problems across all four value drivers for every core action the client must take.
4. **Solutions** — Flip each problem into "How to..." solution language.
5. **Delivery Vehicles** — For each solution, define delivery using the cheat codes (attention level, effort level, medium, format, response speed, 10x/1/10th test).
6. **Trim & Stack** — Cut high-cost/low-value items. Keep low-cost/high-value. Bundle into named deliverables with dollar values.

### Phase 3: Offer Enhancement

Read `references/enhancers.md`.

Layer external forces onto the core offer:

1. **Scarcity** — Choose type: limited seats/slots, limited bonuses, or never-available-again.
2. **Urgency** — Choose type: cohort-based, seasonal, pricing/bonus-based, or exploding opportunity.
3. **Bonuses** — Create bonus stack using the 11-point checklist. Each bonus gets a name, value, and addresses a specific objection. Total bonus value should eclipse core offer value.
4. **Guarantee** — Select and design guarantee type (conditional recommended for agencies). Define stipulations that increase client adherence.
5. **Naming** — Apply the MAGIC formula: Magnetic reason why + Avatar + Goal + Indicate timeframe + Container word.

### Phase 4: Pricing Strategy

Read `references/pricing-strategy.md`.

Set and validate pricing:

1. **1/10th Rule** — Price at 1/10th the value/return clients receive.
2. **Starting Price** — Use recommended ranges based on offer type and proof level.
3. **PIF Strategy** — Structure the pitch as 3-4 months upfront, then monthly retention. Never pitch monthly first.
4. **Price Increase Triggers** — Plan to increase when close rate >30% AND cash collected >50% of contract value.
5. **Virtuous Cycle Check** — Confirm pricing enables investment in better fulfillment, which increases results, which justifies higher prices.

### Phase 5: Ad Strategy

Read `references/ad-strategy.md`.

Design the Meta Ads acquisition system:

1. **Core Rule** — Ads sell the call, not the offer. Lead with outcome and guarantee. Never explain deliverables in ads.
2. **Ad Assembly** — Plan 50 hooks x 3-5 meats x 1-3 CTAs = 150-750 ads per week.
3. **Hook Strategy** — Allocate 80% of effort to hooks. Use the 70-20-10 rule (core/emerging/experimental). Spread hooks across all five awareness levels.
4. **Ad Formats** — Select from: Demonstration, Testimonial, Education, Story, Faceless.
5. **Application Structure** — Design qualifying questions, set cancellation criteria, plan to cancel 10-50% of unqualified bookings.

### Phase 6: Unit Economics & Scale Readiness

Reference the KPI tables in `references/pricing-strategy.md` (bottom section).

Validate the business model can scale:

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Ad spend % of P&L | 20-25% |
| Upfront Cash % | 40-50% |
| Cash ROAS | >2x |
| Revenue ROAS | >5x |
| Close Rate | >25% on qualified live calls |

Calculate CPBC (Cost Per Booked Call) from: price, cash %, close rate, cancel rate, show rate.

## Quick Reference: Key Mental Models

| Model | Core Idea |
|-------|-----------|
| Starving Crowd | Market > Offer > Persuasion skills. Pick a market with massive pain first. |
| Value Equation | Value = (Dream Outcome x Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort). Drive bottom to zero. |
| Grand Slam Offer | An offer so good people feel stupid saying no. Category of one — no comparison shopping. |
| Offer Formula | O = [N + M(V) + T] - R. Niche + Metrics(Volume) + Timeframe - Risk Reversal. |
| 1/10th Rule | Price at 1/10th the value delivered. If ROI >10x, retention solves itself. |
| Virtuous Cycle | Higher price → better clients → better results → more proof → higher price. |
| PIF Strategy | Pitch full program upfront. 50% PIF rate turns 10 closes from $30k to $75k collected. |
| Speak to Top | Frame offer for highest-value clients. 90% buy the downsell by design. |
| Conditional Guarantee | Stipulations increase adherence. Clients do the work to stay eligible → they get results → no refund needed. |
| MAGIC Naming | Magnetic + Avatar + Goal + Indicate timeframe + Container word. Make it un-Googleable. |
| Ad Assembly | 50 hooks x 3-5 meats x 1-3 CTAs. 80% effort on hooks. Better ads > more budget. |
| 70-20-10 Rule | 70% proven hooks, 20% modeled from other niches, 10% experimental. |
